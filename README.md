# Grayson's Weather App - React

Created a web app that brings you the current weather in Celisus and Fahrenheit, and the current weather description of any city using a web api call.

The user-friendly interface was created with the proper labels above each text field. The errors are handled by an alert message to the user, letting the user know the inputted values were incorrect or not found in the system. This would keep program from breaking. 

This project taught me a lot about how to handle web api's in React. The error handling and making the interface was very fun and interesting to create because it made the web app more of a real world web application.
